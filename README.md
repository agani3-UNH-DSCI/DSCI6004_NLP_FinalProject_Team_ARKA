## cyberbullying-detection

Cyberbullying is a prevalent problem on social media that can quite upsetting and troubling. It can take on many different forms, but most social networks tend to see it as text.
Automated detection of these situations requires the use of sophisticated and intelligent technologies. Existing tools for detecting cyberbullying have a lot of constraints. They only touch on one subject, which is cyberbullying. Additionally, they rely on profanity. We demonstrate how deep learning-based models can get beyond these roadblocks.

To effectively train our models, we want to employ publicly accessible datasets, each of which covers a different aspect of cyberbullying. Examples of racism can be seen, for instance, in the Twitter dataset. Additionally, there exist statistics that include instances of sexism. We train our model utilizing Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models like BLSTM. Word embedding is used to model words in order to capture the semantics and similarities between words. Global Vector (GloVe) was selected for word embedding because it has outperformed other models in named entity recognition and word similarity.
Users who publish content that promotes cyberbullying will be reported to the helpline through mail. The algorithm also examines posts about cyberbullying that are viewable by the user.
